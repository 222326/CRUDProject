90's music album database
Languages used: HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript
To use the database, enter the link to the website and enter your favorite 90's music album. After that, you are free to either add more albums or browse around for something new that is already in the database. Make sure to delete any duplicates and fake albums, or use the edit function for speeling errors. Thanks!
